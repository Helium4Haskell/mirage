Short term:

  * [x] Make git & github repositories; fix project structure & split modules; use GtkDrawArea
  * [x] Add port/circle for each child node and appropriate spacing.
  * [x] Add local variables with one port on top and one port at the bottom.
  * [x] Proper layout.
  * [ ] Parse a-terms and extract dependencies (consider using UUAGC)
  * [ ] Hover over attributes to see implementation
  * [ ] Drag background to pan
  * [ ] Drag local variables
  * [ ] Add arrow heads to indicate direction
  * [ ] Add selection menu to select other productions

Long term:

  * [ ] Filtering the display attributes
  * [ ] Ellision of attributes on nodes with too many attributes
  
  * [ ] Indirect dependency analysis (integration with UUAGC)
