Short term:

  * [x] Make git & github repositories; fix project structure & split modules; use GtkDrawArea
  * [x] Add port/circle for each child node and appropriate spacing.
  * [x] Add local variables with one port on top and one port at the bottom.
  * [x] Proper layout.
  * [x] Parse a-terms and extract dependencies (consider using UUAGC)
  * [x] Add selection menu to select other nonterminals and productions
  * [x] Bug: Fix terminals and local variables
  * [x] Make implicit connections visually distinct (light, dotted, thin)
  * [ ] Layout local attributes:
    * [ ] Move downward attributes to the left side
    * [ ] Multiple layers of local variables
  * [ ] Filtering the display attributes
  * [ ] Events:
    * [ ] Hover over attributes to see implementation
    * [ ] Drag background to pan
    * [ ] Drag local variables
    * [ ] Flip local attributes (with right-click maybe?)
  * [ ] Expand all + search box for the side panel
  * [ ] Add arrow heads to indicate direction (make blue disks into triangles)
  * [ ] Better vertical alignment (not centered)
  * [ ] Open multiple files at the same time
  * [ ] Search in sidebar

Long term:

  * [ ] Ordering attributes
  * [ ] Smart filters / heuristic grouping
  * [ ] Persistance
  * [ ] Omission of attributes on nodes with too many attributes
  * [ ] Indirect dependency analysis
