# Mirage

This is the git repository of Mirage, an attribute grammar visualizer for UUAGC
attribute grammars.

To install simply clone this repository and run:

```
$ cabal install
```

This cabal package currently linkes to [this custom mirage branch of UUAGC](https://github.com/noughtmare/uuagc/tree/mirage).
But retrieving that should be handled automatically by cabal.

For more information I invite you to look at the internship report in `report/report.pdf`.
It should give an overview of the functionality and notes about the implementation.

If you want to develop this further you can look at the future work section of
that report and I have also made a brief list of todos in `TODO.md`.

Have fun!
